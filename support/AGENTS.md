# Support app — agent rules

Inherit `../AGENTS.md`. Scope: `support/`; Cloudflare Workers/vinext, Next.js 16, React, Tailwind, Base UI and `next-intl`. Use shared `../app/convex` only. Public regional knowledge-base content at `/de-de` and `/de-en` is readable without login and crawlable where appropriate. Private `/tickets` routes require the existing account's secure identity, verified business ownership and a region match; no second user store. Ensure deep links retain locale and return safely after login.

Each article has verified current UI steps, prerequisites, check result, troubleshooting, ownership and update policy. Search handles synonyms, spelling variants, empty results and keyboard navigation. Ticket thread, attachments and notifications are private; customer queries must never include team-only notes. Validate rich text, file type/size, rate limits, spam and cross-tenant access. Test authenticated cross-subdomain transitions, revocation and open redirects, plus noindex of ticket URLs.

## Legal, payment and privacy guardrails

Follow root `AGENTS.md` and canonical `docs/germany-legal-and-regulatory.md`, `docs/privacy-and-data-governance.md`, and `docs/legal-pages-consents-and-contracts.md`. If this application handles checkout, Stripe, merchant registration, tax receipts or billing, also follow `docs/payments-and-stripe.md` and `docs/tax-invoicing-and-fiscalization.md`. Never assume a draft agreement is approved, or publish an unverified legal guarantee. Original Poppins-based wordmark and logo assets remain authoritative.

Astryx v0.7.1 · 168 components
CLI: run every command as `npx astryx <cmd>` (shown below as `astryx ...`).

SETUP (once, in app entry e.g. main.tsx) — without these, components render unstyled:
  import "@astryxdesign/core/reset.css";
  import "@astryxdesign/core/astryx.css";

WORKFLOW — start every page from a template, never from scratch:
1. `astryx build "<idea>"` — names the template to scaffold from and the parts it lacks.
2. `astryx template <name> <path>` — scaffold it; keep its frame, gap and padding; replace the content.
3. `astryx template <Block>` for parts it lacks; `astryx component <Name>` to read props before using one.
Changing an existing page? Keep it: skip step 2 and add blocks/components inside its sections.

RULES:
- No <div> — components handle all layout and spacing.
- Read `astryx docs layout` before changing a template's frame.
- Dense data = rows (Table, List/Item), not Card-wrapped lists. Badge = counts only.
- Style with component props first, then Tailwind utilities backed by tokens. No raw hex/px.
- Palettes and custom colors go through the theme, never :root overrides. Run `astryx theme add <slug>` to import; `theme eject <slug>` only forks source. See `astryx docs theme`.
- SELF-CHECK: re-read the file; replace any style={{…}}, raw <div>/<span>, imported .css/@apply, or hardcoded/arbitrary value (bg-[#fff], p-[13px]) with the component or a token-backed utility.

`astryx help` lists every command. Key ones beyond the workflow:
  search "<query>"   find any component / hook / doc / template
  discover <words>   integrations you could add
  docs <topic>       getting-started, principles, tokens, theme … (`astryx docs` lists all)
  docs cli           commands, API reference, integration authoring
  upgrade --from <old version> --apply   run after a dependency bump
